  description: >
    The Application Manager API exists to provide Mule Application management operations from Anypoint Control Planes to any Runtime Plane, with capabilities that include:
      - Deploying a Mule Application or API to a Mule Runtime
      - Scaling up or down a running application
      - Managing application settings (ie: properties)
      - Deleting a Mule Application Deployment
      - Changing artifact version or configurations of a deployment
      - Starting, Stopping or Restarting applications
      - etc.
    This API currently supports deployments to Cloudhub 1.0 targets only.
  version: 1.1.0
